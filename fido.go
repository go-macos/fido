// Package fido talks to a FIDO security key over USB HID, in pure Go with
// CGO_ENABLED=0.
//
// It is the SECOND factor. macOS already offers the first through
// go-macos/localauthentication -- Touch ID, a watch, the device passcode --
// and those all answer the same question: is the person at this machine the
// one who unlocked it? A security key answers a different one: is the thing
// they carry present, right now, and did a human touch it? Multi-factor means
// asking both, and getting two independent answers.
//
// # What speaks this
//
// A FIDO authenticator publishes a HID interface on usage page 0xF1D0 with
// 64-byte reports in both directions. It opens without an entitlement and
// without user consent, which is what makes a pure-Go implementation possible
// at all: nothing here goes through a framework, a driver, or cgo.
//
// # CTAPHID
//
// The transport is CTAPHID, from the FIDO CTAP specification. A message is cut
// into 64-byte reports: one INITIALISATION packet carrying the command and the
// total length, then CONTINUATION packets numbered from zero. A channel id is
// negotiated first, with [CmdInit], and every later message carries it.
//
// The framing is in this file and is portable and testable without hardware.
// The transport is a seam, so the whole of it can be driven from a test.
